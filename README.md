## 🚀 Features
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, feature selection, and encoding categorical variables.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Understanding data distribution, feature correlations, and assumptions.  
- **Machine Learning Models:** Random Forest Regressor  
- **Model Evaluation:** Using R² Score, Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).  
- **Visualization:** Residual plots, feature importance, and performance comparison.

## 📊 Results
Model Performance Metrics:  
- **R² Score:** 0.9671  
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** 2.8463  
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** 1.0569
